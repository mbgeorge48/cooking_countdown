# Cooking Countdown ⏲️

[![React CI](https://github.com/mbgeorge48/cooking_countdown/actions/workflows/ci-frontend.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mbgeorge48/cooking_countdown/actions/workflows/ci-frontend.yml)

Have you even been cooking and needed to set a dozen timers to make sure your food is all ready at the same time??

If your answer is yes then this little app might be able to lend a hand.
You enter all each item and the time it takes to cook then when you're ready hit "Go!" and you'll get some instructions printed out to tell you what timers you need to set.

If you want to share those instructions you'll have the option to copy them to the clipboard so you can send them to whoever you like.

## Getting started

This was built using create-react-app to get started.
Firstly make sure you've got `yarn` installed, if you haven't then do so with this command

```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

Now you can just run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start`

Easy!
